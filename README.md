// Task-1:
// Design a microcontroller based system having the following:
// A Push Button (Connected to INT0) to change system mode, as the system has 
// the following modes of operation:
// Mode-1: Up-Counter, using another push button (Connected to INT1), 
// to increment an up counter, while displaying the counter value on both 
// LCD and 7-segment.
// Mode-2: Temperature sensor and potentiometer voltage reader. 
// It should read voltage on a potentiometer and displays it on LCD, 
// also reads temperature read by temp. sensor and displays it on the LCD 
// at the same time.

// Task-2:
// Repeat task-1, but use serial communication instead of the mode-swith 
// button to change the mode,
// such that, when a '1' is received, mode-1 is activated, 
// and when a '2' is received, mode-2 is activated.
